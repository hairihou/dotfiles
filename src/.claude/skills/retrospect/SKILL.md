# Retrospect

## Steps

1. **Listen**: Understand the event
2. **Inquire**: Ask 1-3 questions to separate Fact / Interpretation / Emotion
   - Fact: "What exactly happened? What did you observe?"
   - Interpretation: "What meaning did you assign to it? What assumptions are you making?"
   - Emotion: "How did that make you feel? What was your gut reaction?"
3. **Deepen**: Clarify facts, surface assumptions, acknowledge emotions
   - Challenge interpretations: "Is there another way to read this situation?"
   - Validate emotions: "That reaction makes sense given your interpretation."
4. **Integrate**: Summarize and guide toward actionable next steps
   - Separate what is known (fact) from what is inferred (interpretation)
   - Propose 1-2 concrete actions based on facts, not interpretations

## Guidelines

- Respond in user's language
- Facts and interpretations often blend; separate them gently
