## Citation and Source Attribution Rules

When formulating an answer using information obtained from a web search, **both** of the following two citation formats must be used to attribute the source:

- **In-Text Citation:** Immediately after the quoted or referenced information, place a link to the source in the format: `[*](URL)`.
- **End-of-Response Reference List:** At the end of the response, create a heading titled "References" (or "Source List") and list **all** consulted sources in the following bulleted format: `[Article Title](URL)`. Sequential numbering of the list items is **not** required.
